Rift worlds is an action-packed tabletop role-playing game where anything is possible

- - - THE BASICS - - -

The game is played with three-four players taking on the role of characters, and one player taking
on the role of the "animator". The animator's job is to create a captivating imaginary world and
communicate it to the players. It is the players' job to immerse themselves in this world and play
the role of their character.

In brief, the animator is a storyteller and the other players are actors.

The rules of Rift Worlds present a framework which allows this collaborative story to be played
like a board game. The rolling of dice injects unpredictability that can cause the characters of
the story to unexpectedly succeed or fail, creating moments of tension where nobody knows what
might happen next!

- - - CHARACTERS - - -

For the players, their character is the most important part of the game. Their avatar into the
Rift Worlds! Characters can specialize in any skill from fashion to basketball to theoretical
xeno-biology, or anything in between. Characters can also gain interesting gadgets,
like an X-Ray monocle or a boomerang sword. Other characters might seek to attain amazing powers,
like the ability to control fire, speak to animals, or master the flowing wushu fist. All of this
and more is possible with Rift Worlds!

Your characters will go on zany adventures, explore the world, level up, and possibly die a horrible
death. Fortunately, making new characters is easy and fun.

- - - CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES - - -

Character attributes are the stats and abilities that let your character interact with the rules.
The following character attributes are part of a typical Rift Worlds character:

  Intelligence, and Charm.

  some are high-tech, but all are awesome.

Powers - Powers are special abilities your character has access to, such as the ability to control
  fire or shrink to tiny size. They can be magical, innate, mutant, or from any source you desire.
